INTRODUCTION					*coffee-script*
						*coffee-script-introduction*

This plugin provides facilities for editing CoffeeScript, including syntax
highlighting, indenting and compilation.  Also included is syntax support for
Eco templates, and handling of {text/coffeescript} in HTML.


COMMANDS					*coffee-script-commands*

						*:CoffeeMake*
:CoffeeMake {opts}	Calls |:make!|, with 'makeprg' being "coffee -c" plus
			any additional {opts} given.  Opens the |quickfix|
			window if there are any errors and jumps to the first
			error.  You may set |g:coffee_make_options| to specify
			default command-line options that will always be
			passed.  By default, all compiler output is shown --
			running with |:silent| will hide this.

						*:CoffeeMake!*
:CoffeeMake! {opts}	As with :CoffeeMake, but will not jump to the first
			error.

						*:CoffeeCompile*
:[range]CoffeeCompile [vertical] [{win-size}]
			Shows how the current file or [range] will be compiled
			to JavaScript.  [vertical] (or vert) splits the
			compile buffer vertically instead of horizontally, and
			{win-size} sets the initial size of the buffer. It can
			be closed quickly with the "q" key.

:CoffeeCompile {watch} [vertical] [{win-size}]
			The watch mode of :CoffeeCompile emulates the "Try
			CoffeeScript" live preview on the CoffeeScript web
			site -- after making changes to the source file,
			exiting insert mode will cause the preview buffer to
			update automatically.  {watch} should be given as
			"watch" or "unwatch," where the latter will of course
			stop the automatic updating. [vertical] is
			recommended, and 'scrollbind' is useful.

						*:CoffeeRun*
:[range]CoffeeRun	Compiles the file or [range] and runs the resulting
			JavaScript, displaying the output.


SETTINGS					*coffee-script-settings*

You can configure plugin behavior by setting global variables or syntax
highlighting directives in your |vimrc|.

Global Settings~

You may set these in your |vimrc| as illustrated below.

						*g:coffee_make_options*  >
	let g:coffee_make_options='--bare'
Always include the specified options when compiling with |:CoffeeCompile|.

Syntax Highlighting~
						*ft-coffee-script-syntax*
Trailing whitespace is highlighted as an error by default. This can be
disabled with:
>
	hi link coffeeSpaceError NONE

Trailing semicolons are also considered an error (for help transitioning from
JavaScript.) This can be disabled with:
>
	hi link coffeeSemicolonError NONE

Reserved words like {function} and {var} are highlighted as an error in
contexts disallowed by CoffeeScript. This can be disabled with:
>
	hi link coffeeReservedError NONE
